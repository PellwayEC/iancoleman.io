<h1>Donations</h1>

<h2>I don't accept donations</h2>

<p>
Since my projects are often the efforts of many people, most of which don't
appear in the obvious places like code or issues, donating to projects I work on
poses significant operational difficulties.
</p>

<p>
As a result, if you would like to support the work on this site financially you
are encouraged to donate to one of the many groups that makes the internet a
place amenable to sites such as this one.
